# A DEEP LEARNING APPROACH UTILIZING COVARIANCE MATRIX ANALYSIS FOR THE ISBI EDITED MRS RECONSTRUCTION CHALLENGE

## Abstract

Edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides a non-invasive method for investigating low concentration metabolites, such as Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The ISBI Edited MRS Reconstruction Challenge aims at accelerating edited-MRS scans through machine learning models that reconstruct high-quality spectra using four times less data than standard scans. It is composed of three tracks: simulated data, single-vendor, and multi-vendor in-vivo data, each with edited ON and OFF spectra from GABA-edited MEGA-PRESS scans.

This work presents a deep learning method for reconstruction of edited MRS spectra capable of operating with an arbitrary number of available measurement repetitions. It proposes to compute the sample covariance matrix of the measurements and use it as the input of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract relevant signal features and produce a high-quality spectrum. The results indicate that the method can perform effectively even with highly noisy data obtained from a single acquisition, and its performance can be further enhanced with multiple acquisitions.
